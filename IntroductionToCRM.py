#region What is KPI?

"""KPI (Key Performance Indicator) is a measurable value that demonstrates how effectively an individual, team, or organization is achieving key business objectives. KPIs are used to track performance over time, aligning efforts toward specific goals and providing insights into areas of improvement. They can be high-level, such as overall business profitability, or low-level, such as sales conversion rates or customer satisfaction scores.

Characteristics of KPIs:
1. Specific: Clear and focused on a particular aspect of performance.
2. Measurable: Quantifiable to track progress accurately.
3. Achievable: Realistic and within reach.
4. Relevant: Directly linked to the business's objectives.
5. Time-bound: Defined within a timeframe to measure progress.

KPIs are categorized into:
- Lagging KPIs: Measure past performance (e.g., quarterly revenue).
- Leading KPIs: Predict future outcomes (e.g., customer inquiries or leads).

Ultimately, KPIs help organizations gauge their success, make data-driven decisions, and align teams towards strategic objectives. ðŸš€


e.g.

Here are some shorter KPI examples:

Net Profit Margin: Profit as a percentage of total revenue.
Sales Conversion Rate: Percentage of leads that turn into customers.
Customer Satisfaction (CSAT): Customer feedback score on satisfaction.
Inventory Turnover: How often inventory is sold and replaced.
Employee Retention Rate: Percentage of employees who stay with the company.
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): Cost to acquire a new customer.
