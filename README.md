# CRM Analytics üìä
This repository contains the exercises completed during Week One and Two of the Miuul Data Scientist Bootcamp. These exercises are part of the first module of the bootcamp, focusing on foundational Python programming concepts, including data structures, functions, conditions, loops, comprehensions, and data analysis. Each file demonstrates practical implementations and examples designed to build a strong programming foundation.


## Introduction üßê
When I started with CRM analytics, I learned various concepts and applications. Some key concepts I discovered during this process are as follows:

### What is CRM? ü§î
CRM (Customer Relationship Management) refers to software and strategies for managing customer relationships. I realized how critical it is to effectively manage customer interactions in the business world.

### Key Learnings:
- **Customer Lifecycle Optimization:** By better understanding customer journeys, I learned how to enhance my marketing strategies.
- **Customer Segmentation:** I discovered the importance of segmenting customers based on data to create personalized strategies.
- **Cohort Analysis:** Analyzing the behavior of a specific segment over time helped me understand customers more effectively.

### What is CRM Analytics? üìä
I adopted an approach of analyzing CRM data to understand customer behaviors. This allowed me to add data-driven insights to business decisions.

### RFM Analysis üìâ
RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) is a powerful technique I used to examine customer behavior. Through this analysis, I evaluated when customers last made a purchase, how frequently they make purchases, and how much they spend.

#### Key Learnings:
- **RFM Analysis:** By segmenting customers, I learned how to implement more targeted marketing strategies.

### CLTV Calculations and Segmentation üí∞
I applied Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) calculations to understand the long-term value of customers.

#### Key Learnings:
- **CLTV Calculation:** By predicting how valuable a customer will be, I realized the importance of using this data for customer segmentation.

## Case Study 5 üìù
During this case study, I followed the steps below to work with CRM data:

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** In the first step, I explored the flo_data_20K.csv file and cleaned any missing values. I learned how critical it is to prepare the data correctly for accurate analysis results.

2. **Creating New Variables:** I created new metrics, especially for omnichannel customers, such as the number of purchases and total spending.

3. **Data Analysis:** I ranked customers based on their spending and order frequency. Through this, I discovered how better understanding customer behavior can lead to more effective marketing strategies.

## Case Study 6 üìö
In this case study, I conducted more advanced analyses on CRM data and created CLTV predictions:

1. **Outlier Removal and Data Cleaning:** I suppressed outliers to achieve more accurate and consistent data. This process had a significant impact on model accuracy.

2. **CLTV Calculation:** I performed CLTV predictions to calculate the future value of customers. This helped me realize the importance of long-term marketing strategies.

3. **Modeling and Results:** By using BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma models for CLTV calculations, I was able to clearly identify which customers were the most valuable.

## What I Learned üß†

### Customer Lifecycle and Marketing Strategies
I learned how analyzing the customer journey can significantly improve marketing efforts. By optimizing this process, businesses can provide a more personalized experience and enhance customer loyalty.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
I gained hands-on experience in data cleaning, including handling missing values and outliers. This step is crucial in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data used for analysis.

### RFM and CLTV Analysis
By applying RFM and CLTV techniques, I deepened my understanding of how to segment customers and predict their future value, allowing businesses to prioritize high-value customers.

### Segmentation for Targeted Marketing
The importance of segmentation for creating personalized marketing campaigns became clearer to me. I learned that one-size-fits-all approaches are less effective than tailored strategies.

### Advanced Modeling Techniques
I applied models like BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma for CLTV predictions. This experience taught me the importance of advanced statistical techniques in analyzing customer data and making informed business decisions.
