"""**Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)** is a metric that estimates the total revenue a business can expect from a customer over the entire duration of their relationship. It helps businesses identify which customers are the most valuable and allocate resources effectively.

### **Key Concepts:**
1. **Recency (R):** How recently a customer made a purchase.
2. **Frequency (F):** How often they purchase.
3. **Monetary Value (M):** How much they spend.

### **Methods for Prediction:**
1. **Basic Methods:**
    - Average revenue calculation.
    - RFM Segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary scores).

2. **Statistical Models:**
    - Pareto/NBD and Gamma-Gamma for purchase frequency and spending predictions.

3. **Machine Learning Models:**
    - Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or even Deep Learning models for more advanced forecasts.

### **Importance:**
- Helps focus resources on high-value customers.
- Improves decision-making in marketing, sales, and customer retention strategies.
